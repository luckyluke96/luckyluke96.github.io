        <h2>Welcome to our survey!</h2>
        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
        <p>This study tries to examine the interaction between humans and chatbots. First, you will interact with a chatbot that was developed by students from the Saarland University and from the University of Hamburg in Germany. The chatbot simulates the scenario of cancelling an order in an outdoor online shop.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the last message of your interaction, the chatbot will provide you with a link to a questionnaire. In the questionnaire, you are asked multiple questions about your experience with the chatbot. 
        <br>
        If you have any questions or additional remarks, please contact <a href= "mailto:lukas.oberfrank@uni-hamburg.com">lukas.oberfrank@uni-hamburg.com</a>.</p>
