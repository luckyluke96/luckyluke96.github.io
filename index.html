        <h2>Welcome to our survey!</h2>
        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
        <p>This study tries to examine the interaction between humans and chatbots. First, you will interact with a chatbot that was developed by students from the Saarland University and from the University of Hamburg in Germany. In the last message of your interaction, the chatbot will provide you with a link to a questionnaire. In the questionnaire, you are asked multiple questions about your experience with the chatbot. If you have any technical questions or additional remarks, please contact <a href= "mailto:lukas.oberfrank@uni-hamburg.com">lukas.oberfrank@uni-hamburg.com</a>.</p>

        <p>The survey is anonymous and no conclusions can be drawn about your person. The data collected will be used exclusively for scientific purposes as part of this research project. Therefore, only anonymous, non-personal data is stored and processed. It is not possible to draw any conclusions about participants. Participation is voluntary and can be canceled at any time without giving reasons.

        <br>
        If you participate from SurveyCircle, we will provide the SurveyCircle code at the end of the questionnaire.</p>
